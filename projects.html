            <br>
          I developed a personal website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
          create a sleek online presence. The website showcases my key projects,
          skill sets, and a personal bio. Utilizing frameworks such as
          Bootstrap, I enhanced the site's design and responsiveness.
          Additionally, I integrated a 'Contact Me' form to facilitate email
          submissions, leading to a higher rate of engagement with visitors.
          This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end web development
          and my ability to create functional, user-friendly interfaces.

             <p class="project-title">Budgeting System Application
               <br> Jan 2023 – April 2023</p>
                  <br>
                  This project was a collaborative effort completed as a team of five members, emphasizing teamwork and collective problem-solving. The project is a Java-based budgeting system designed to give individuals and households an easy-to-use tool for managing their finances effectively. The goal is to simplify the experience by enabling users to log and monitor their expenses, create budgets, and receive reminders for future payments and bills. Recognizing that handling finances can be challenging, this application aims to minimize inconveniences.

                  Key features include budgeting by category, record grouping and search, budget reworking, updating and deleting purchase information, and payment notifications for managing finances effectively. The project consists of several major packages, including user implements, budgeting system, printing information, and UI elements. The user implements package handles user data, while the budgeting system segregates data into income, user info, and purchase info. A user manager interface facilitates easy manipulation of user data, allowing for future class expansions and bug fixes.
                  
                  The GUI class, designed to handle extensive user input, is the largest class to minimize the number of handlers needed. It allows users to create and validate purchases, define budgets by category, and modify budgets as their financial situation evolves. Additional features include record grouping, searching by date, category, and price, and calculating the difference between earnings and expenses over a period.

                    <br>
                    July 2022 – August 2022
                 </p>
                      <br>
                      This project involved developing a simple database management system for a fitness club using C programming language. The system maintains records for members of a fitness club, each containing the member's name, age, height, Body Mass Index (BMI), and weight group based on BMI. The project required implementing a customized data structure and a self-referential data structure, utilizing array of pointers to structures, dynamic memory allocation, and formatted input/output.

                      The database maintains an array of pointers to member records, each implemented as a structure. The main functionalities of the system include accepting new member records, displaying all records, removing existing records, updating weight information, sorting records, and clearing the database. The program continuously prompts the user with a menu of options to perform these operations until the user chooses to quit.

                      Key Features:
                      
                      
                      Adding new member records with automatic BMI calculation and weight group assignment,
                      Displaying all member records in the database,
                      Removing specific member records by name,
                      Updating the weight information of members and tracking changes in weight groups
                      and sorting records by name or BMI.

                          <br>
                          March 2022 – April 2022
                       </p>
                       For this project, I developed a comprehensive object-oriented program to simulate a virtual hospital environment. The system efficiently manages patients, physicians, administrators, and volunteers while adhering to strict organizational rules and policies. Key features include patient management, such as admission and discharge processes, assignment to physicians, and maintaining unique patient records. Additionally, the system handles staff management, including the hiring and resignation of volunteers, physicians, and administrators, along with their respective assignments and reassignments. The project incorporates essential OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and exception handling, ensuring robust management of special cases such as maximum capacity and the unavailability of specific roles. This project highlights my ability to implement complex systems using Java, with a strong emphasis on code quality and proper documentation.
